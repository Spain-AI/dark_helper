# DARK HELPER

Until today there have been many revolutions: the industrial revolution, the Arab spring, the American revolution ...

Today we are going to create a new one! Remember you are watching **Dark** and continually having to be pausing and looking for the characters, biography, the family tree ... Well, friend! This is over! With **DARK HELPER** you can see in real time who the hell those characters are, who their fucking mother is and why the hell he's young now.

We want times of peace, we want to see dark without having the anxiety of not understanding anything.

**Dark helper** allows you to capture a piece of the screen or the full screen and it will tell you who appears in each scene. Isn't it fucking gorgeous?
